percona_mysql
=========

Role installs, configure and secure percona mysql on Debian-like systems.

Role Variables
--------------


Example Playbook
----------------

Setup per group/host variables to host/group vars and run role.

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: davidkarban.mysql_percona }
